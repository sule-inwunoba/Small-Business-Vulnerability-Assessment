# Small-Business-Vulnerability-Assessment

## Objective
The Vulnerability Assessment aimed to simulate a real-world environment for evaluating security risks and potential vulnerabilities in a small business database system. The primary goal was to assess the likelihood and impact of security breaches by identifying common threats such as data exfiltration, unauthorized access, and data manipulation.

### Skills Learned
- Comprehensive understanding of vulnerability assessment methodologies.
- Ability to perform risk analysis based on threat likelihood and impact.
- Proficiency in applying NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 standards to guide risk assessments.
- Strong knowledge of security protocols such as SSL/TLS encryption and role-based access controls.
- Enhanced problem-solving and critical thinking for identifying and remediating security risks.
